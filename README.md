# About
The Golden Minds Colleges-Academy Official Website journey began in 2020 when the initial version was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My passion for web development started when I enrolled in Golden Minds Colleges-Academy for Senior High School, pursuing the Technical Vocational Livelihood (TVL) strand in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Eager to deepen my skills, I began to study advanced web development technologies on my own.

During Grade 12, I led my group in developing an Inventory System for HRM Tools and Equipment as our thesis project. Our team's dedication and innovation were recognized, earning us the title of Best Thesis for Innovation.

Following this achievement, I was invited by my school to join their development team. Initially, I focused on creating static sites as part of my training. Over time, I was entrusted with the responsibility of rebuilding and enhancing the Official Website of Golden Minds Colleges-Academy using my chosen tech stack. Currently, I am the sole developer for this project, overseeing all aspects of its maintenance, development, and updates to ensure it remains a valuable resource for the school community.
